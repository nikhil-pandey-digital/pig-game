 A Two player game  which is really entertaining and exciting to play 😍 give it a try 🙂

rules of the game:-
  1) there are two players and there are two type of scores for each player 
               1. current score , which is temporary and will set to 0 if dice is 1
               2. total score, which is  permanent and you need to hold the dice in order to add the current score to the total score
  
  every player has two options 
       option 1--> roll the dice and the dice no. will be added to the current score of that player 
                    NOTE:- if dice is 1 then current score  will set to 0 and all your current score will be lost
                    
       option 2--> hold the position,  that will add the current score to the total score 
       
       the player who first scores 100 points will win the game :-)
